## Question 1 

let's see the data: 
```{r data1 , echo=FALSE}
data1 = c(34.94741,36.43065,38.88051,44.87584,33.87255,44.53838,46.51286,40.00055,39.58525,29.83911,33.95191,33.38044,40.35871,36.5835,41.62225,37.97239,40.79804,52.42555,36.5318,41.75252,45.98396,34.06382,39.87921,32.17747,34.97369,36.60897,25.10078,36.56173,43.69468,36.01478,37.78487,39.21097,37.92249,33.57567,42.70137,40.10378,42.05202,31.66424,40.88883,36.9239,42.56832,39.81843,41.84852,38.63884,38.35706,41.96315,26.79693,37.72657,41.01918,40.43876,37.73126,43.47612,37.25333,34.62033,30.27109,31.39049,35.68712,38.22371,40.01673,36.86875,45.0478,35.36616,37.50769,35.90788,39.8686,34.83109,37.74238,41.56279,30.84202,43.84655,35.99772,42.96221,36.09905,35.92652,37.716,44.34019,43.55543,36.65793,41.75036,47.5828,37.2114,40.72289,36.78353,35.81215,41.41033,33.89134,40.70251,32.07049,34.63154,32.63566,34.53586,29.68824,39.75593,43.8727,41.77806,42.10868,37.46186,36.90915,42.36702,39.27819,39.91961,36.18496,35.02009,52.73107,39.6417,34.08292,32.28044,37.73725,45.49712,39.20092,49.13816,41.01121,36.2312,37.17248,32.75391,25.02892,40.76772,31.513,37.35292,39.72741,52.40044,37.94712,37.81213,33.31573,41.37348,37.44517,38.13406,33.98064,34.35229,39.16289,38.90527,30.55125,28.09732,39.76255,45.69683,39.19257,38.73446,38.31262,50.57317,38.09171,40.29984,39.23567,34.52332,34.83343,40.97337,37.42913,33.35084,41.24324,31.57102,43.56069,39.40064,38.68893,35.85884,37.43592,38.00529,33.46853,38.35598,30.47499,35.13314,34.07381,35.23753,44.4316,37.35232,41.79673,43.99492,36.94681,29.9422,35.94959,40.88906,35.97818,39.60198,42.98842,43.35058,36.67519,36.53764,44.44284,39.78244,41.15475,39.28284,44.69583,35.36799,33.67447,44.16497,38.04007,43.89457,33.63423,41.42692,40.90067,46.45874,38.5735,40.71161,36.64425,31.43732,45.6379,35.21455,39.09901,31.73881,42.98602,35.71056,41.84708)

```

```{r data}
hist(data1, breaks = 15)
summary(data1)
```

density function is :
```{r dens}
f_x= function(x, mu, gamma ){ 
  exp(-(x-mu)/gamma)/ (gamma*(1+exp(-(x-mu)/gamma))^2)
}
#likelihood: 
lik = function (xvec,theta){ ##theta=(mu,gamma)
  n = length(xvec)
  ll=(-sum(xvec)+ n*theta[1])/theta[2] - 2* sum(log(theta[2]+exp(-xvec-theta[1])))
  return(ll)
}
# unnormalized pi will be : 
pi = function(xvec , theta ){
  lik(xvec, theta) * exp((-theta[1]^2)/50) * exp(-theta[2]/10) 
}
# now we compute full conditionals : f(mu| X,gamma)
f_mu = function(xvec, theta ){
  lik(xvec, theta) * exp((-theta[1]^2)/50)
}
# full conditional : f(gamma| X,mu)
f_gamma = function(xvec , theta ){
  lik(xvec,theta) * exp(-theta[2]/10) 
}
```

Now we can consrtruct metropolis-hastings algortithm : 
```{r MH}
#initialize markov chain:(mu,gamma), take the mean of prior distributions for initial
set.seed(501)
chain_length= 15000
MH = matrix(NA, chain_length, 3,dimnames = list(NULL,c("index","mu","gamma")))
MH[1,]= c(1, 38.2924, 2.6)
proposal = function(theta){
  p1=rnorm(1,theta[1],1)
  p2=rnorm(1,theta[2],1)
  return(c(p1,p2))
}
naccept = 1
i = 2
for (i in 2:chain_length){
  MH[i,1]=i
  propose = proposal(c(MH[i-1,2],MH[i-1,3])) # make a proposal for new mu and gamma
  alpha_1 = min(f_mu(data1,c(propose[1],MH[i-1,3]))*dnorm(MH[i-1,2],MH[i-1,2],1)/
                f_mu(data1,c(MH[i-1,2],MH[i-1,3]))/dnorm(propose[1],MH[i-1,2],1) , 1)
  alpha_2 = min(f_gamma(data1,c(MH[i-1,2],propose[2]))*dnorm(MH[i-1,3],MH[i-1,3],1)/
                f_gamma(data1,c(MH[i-1,2],MH[i-1,3]))/dnorm(propose[2],MH[i-1,3],1) , 1)
  if (runif(1)< alpha_1){ MH[i,2]= propose[1] }else{MH[i,2]= MH[i-1,2]}
   if (runif(1)< alpha_2){ MH[i,3]= propose[2] }else{MH[i,3]= MH[i-1,3]}
}
```
To determine the statring values I used the R package : `fitdist` Which is used to fit the logistic distribution to the observed data via :  `si = fitdist(data1,"logis")` this uses Mle to estimate the parameters distribution with observed data, then I get :
```{r sv}
library(fitdistrplus)
si = fitdist(data1,"logis")
si
```
Which i used as starting values.  
looking at the chain : 
```{r plt}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(MH[,2],breaks =30, main="Posterior of mu" ,xlab="mu")
hist(MH[,3],breaks =30, main="Posterior of gamma" ,xlab="gamma")
plot(MH[,2], type = "l", xlab="mu" , main = "Chain values of mu")
plot(MH[,3], type = "l", xlab="gamma" , main = "Chain values of gamma")
```
This chain seems to mix well, mainlt due to the choice of starting values, and does not seem to have a problem. 
Using `mcmcse` package to compute standard errors for parameter estimates : 
```{r se}
library(mcmcse)
gamma_square= MH[,3]^2
mu_gamma = MH[,2]/MH[,3]
## mu 
mcse(MH[,2],size="sqroot")
##Gamma
mcse(MH[,3],size="sqroot")
### Gamma squared
mcse(gamma_square,size="sqroot")
###mu/gamma
mcse(mu_gamma,size="sqroot")
```
